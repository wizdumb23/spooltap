# Deploying SpoolTap V2

A portable install guide. SpoolTap is a Home Assistant custom integration that talks to a
**Bambuddy** instance over REST — Bambuddy is the single source of truth for all inventory,
tag, assignment, and weight data. **Since v0.2.0 the HACS install is the whole product**: the
integration ships the engine (sensors + `spooltap.*` services), the workflow (the two-tap
dispatch and all the `select./number./text./switch./button.spooltap_*` control entities), and
the dashboard (auto-created in your sidebar). No `packages/` file, no `configuration.yaml`
edits.

The integration stores **no** HA-instance-specific state except one thing you build yourself:
the **slot→tag registry** (which NFC tag is on which AMS slot). It ships **empty** — you
populate it once, in Bind mode. Nothing is ever written *to* an NFC tag; only its factory UID
is read.

---

## Prerequisites

- A running **Bambuddy** instance, reachable from your HA host, with the **Bambuddy↔Spoolman**
  sync **OFF** (Bambuddy → Settings → Filament). The integration raises a notification if it's
  on. This toggle is Bambuddy's own consumption sync — it is *not* the Spoolman service, so
  turning it off does not disturb any separate Spoolman you may run.
- Home Assistant **2025.6.0+**.
- For the dashboard's styling: **button-card** + **card-mod** (HACS → Frontend). These are
  the only pieces HACS can't bundle with the integration. *(Pre-0.3.0 dashboards used
  Mushroom instead of button-card; Mushroom is no longer required.)*

## Install

1. HACS → ⋮ → **Custom repositories** → `https://github.com/dmuth23/spooltap`, category
   **Integration** → install **SpoolTap** → **restart Home Assistant**.
2. Settings → Devices & Services → **Add Integration** → **SpoolTap** → enter your Bambuddy
   URL. `cannot_connect` means your HA box can't reach Bambuddy — that's a networking fix
   before anything else. Bambuddy's authentication is off by default, so the API key field
   can stay empty; with authentication **on**, `invalid_auth` means you need a Bambuddy API
   key carrying the `can_read_status` and `can_manage_inventory` scopes.
3. Done. The **SpoolTap** dashboard appears in the sidebar (auto-created; if you ever delete
   or break it, run the `spooltap.install_dashboard` service — `force: true` restores the
   shipped layout). Spool tags already bound in Bambuddy resolve immediately.

## Register the AMS slot tags (one time)

Bambuddy has no per-slot tag concept, so HA owns the slot→tag map — and it ships **empty**.
On the dashboard: **Bind** mode → **Bind Mode** on → for each AMS slot, tap the slot's NFC
tag → pick that slot → **Bind Tag to Slot**. The Bind page's table shows each slot as
bound/unbound. (No tag reader handy? Use the paste field or the tag-registry picker instead
of scanning.)

## Acceptance test (first assign on an IDLE printer)

Two-tap a slot then a tagged spool and confirm in Bambuddy that the spool's `tag_uid` is
still intact after the AMS echoes the assignment, and that the tray configures when the
printer is reachable. (The AMS echo *cannot* clobber an assigned spool's tag — verified in
the Bambuddy source — so this is confirmation, not discovery.)

## Weight recertification (the Modify workflow)

The Modify form loads the spool's current values — check **Remaining** against your scale
first; if it matches, there's nothing to fix. To recertify: put the spool on the scale, type
the reading into the **Gross** box, and **Save**.

**What Save does** (`flows.py` → `async_mod_save`): with a gross > 0 it calls `weigh_spool(gross)`
then `modify_spool(weight_locked=True)` — weigh-and-lock in one step. Bambuddy computes
`net = gross − core_weight` and `weight_used = label_weight − net` (Remaining is derived, never
stored), corrects in **both** directions (a spool heavier than tracked *lowers* `weight_used`),
and stamps `last_scale_weight` + `last_weighed_at`. The SpoolBuddy hardware pad runs the same
math — it only tares the empty pad; the backend still subtracts the spool's core weight.

**Only two inputs can lie to you.** Everything is `Remaining = gross − core_weight`, so accuracy
rides entirely on the spool's **core weight** (the empty-spool tare — pulled from a per-brand
catalog, *not* a measurement of your spool) and its **label weight** (is it really a 1 kg spool?).
If a Remaining reads obviously wrong, the tare is off → fix **Empty Spool Weight in Bambuddy's
Inventory UI, then re-weigh**. ⚠ The Modify form's own core field is **display-only** — it only
previews `net` on screen; `weigh_spool` sends just the gross and BB recomputes with its *stored*
core weight, so editing the form's core changes nothing about the committed value.

**Gross box, not Net box.** Always use **Gross** (the scale reading, spool included). The Net box
is only for when you already know remaining and aren't weighing — typing a gross number there
commits `weight_used = label − gross` (badly inflated) and auto-locks it.

**"Reset usage" is not a step.** In local (De-Spoolman) mode nothing zeros `weight_used`. The only
reset — `POST /spools/{id}/reset-consumed-counter` (formerly the misnamed `/reset-usage`) — just
stamps `weight_used_baseline = weight_used` to zero the cosmetic "Total Consumed" widget; Remaining,
`weight_used`, and `weight_locked` are untouched. So there is **nothing to reset before a weigh-in**
(weighing overwrites `weight_used` regardless); run it *after* only if that widget bothers you.
(`weight_used → 0` exists only in the Spoolman backend, which V2 does not use.)

**What the lock protects.** `weight_locked=true` makes **both** of BB's coarse remain%-based writers
skip the spool: the automatic MQTT AMS sync (`main.py`, increase-only, never mid-print) **and** the
manual "Sync AMS weights" recovery tool (`inventory.py` → `POST /sync-ams-weights`). BB's precise
per-print 3MF tracker **ignores** the lock and keeps deducting real grams, so tracking continues
from the certified value.

> **Correction, verified against BB source (`inventory.py:1692`, 2026-07-04):** earlier guidance
> said *"never run the Sync AMS weights tool after a recertify — it force-overwrites from remain% in
> both directions."* That tool **skips `weight_locked` spools**, and a recertify locks the spool — so
> a recertified spool is safe from it. It overwrites (both directions, bypassing the only-increase
> guard) **only for unlocked, assigned** spools.

**Reconciliation marker.** Each weigh stamps `last_weighed_at`. After a full weigh-pass, any *active*
spool still showing `last_weighed_at = null` is one you never physically handled → an archive
shortlist candidate.

## Moving Bambuddy to another host (0.3.3+)

SpoolTap only knows Bambuddy by the URL you entered, so nothing about *where* Bambuddy runs
matters — HA add-on, Docker, Pi, NAS. When that URL changes (for example Bambuddy leaves the
HA add-on for a Docker host), re-point the integration in place:

1. Wait until the new Bambuddy answers: `curl http://<new-host>:8000/api/v1/printers/`.
2. Settings → Devices & Services → **SpoolTap** → ⋮ → **Reconfigure** → enter the new URL
   (and an API key if Bambuddy authentication is on) → Submit.
3. The entry reloads. Check `sensor.spooltap_slots` still shows your bound slot tags.

Reconfigure keeps the config entry, so the slot→tag registry, the entities, and the dashboard
all survive. Deleting and re-adding the integration instead keeps the entities and dashboard
but **loses the slot registry** (it is stored per config entry) — you would have to re-bind
every slot tag. Pre-0.3.3 installs have no Reconfigure menu item: update SpoolTap first.

Use plain `http://host:8000` unless you run a TLS proxy with a certificate HA trusts —
Bambuddy itself serves plain HTTP.

## Upgrading to 0.3.0 (glass dashboard + restructured status sensor)

1. Install **button-card** from HACS → Frontend if you don't have it (card-mod you already
   have; Mushroom is no longer used by the shipped dashboard and may be removed unless
   something else on your instance uses it).
2. HACS → update SpoolTap → **restart Home Assistant**.
3. Run the `spooltap.install_dashboard` service with `force: true` once — the auto-install
   never overwrites an existing dashboard, so the new layout only lands when you ask for it.

**Breaking change — `sensor.spooltap_status`:** its state used to be the status *message*;
since 0.3.0 the state is the status **level** — one of `Idle / Ready / Armed / Working /
Success / Warning / Error / Info` — and the message moved to the `message` attribute
(alongside `updated_at` and `busy`). If you templated on the old state, read
`state_attr('sensor.spooltap_status', 'message')` instead; if you want to react to
outcomes, trigger on the state itself (e.g. `to: "Error"`). The shipped dashboard was the
only known consumer and is updated in the same release.

---

## Upgrading from 0.1.x (the three-piece install)

v0.1.x needed a `packages/spooltap_v2.yaml` file and a `lovelace:` YAML-mode dashboard next
to the integration. 0.2.0 replaces both with native `spooltap_*` entities and an auto-created
storage dashboard. To upgrade:

1. **Remove the old pieces from your config**: delete `packages/spooltap_v2.yaml`, the
   dashboard YAML file, and the `lovelace: dashboards: spooltap-v2:` block in
   `configuration.yaml`. (Leaving the package in place double-fires every scan; leaving the
   YAML dashboard registered squats the `spooltap-v2` url and blocks the auto-install.)
2. **HACS → update SpoolTap to 0.2.0**, then **restart once**.
3. The integration recreates the dashboard itself. Your slot→tag registry is preserved (and
   migrated to canonical tag form automatically).
4. Cosmetic cleanup: the old `stv2_*` helpers become `unavailable` registry ghosts — delete
   them in Settings → Devices & Services → **Entities** (filter `stv2`, select all, delete).

## Running alongside an existing SpoolTap V1 (parallel cutover)

V1 and V2 coexist cleanly: different domains and namespaces, separate dashboards, different
data stores (V1 reads Spoolman; V2 reads Bambuddy). The one rule for a live parallel run:
**only one system may actively WRITE to the AMS.** Disable these 8 V1 automations
(Settings → Automations):

| Automation (alias) | id |
|---|---|
| NFC: Scan dispatch (Slot/Spool routing) | `nfc_phase_a_dispatch` |
| NFC: Queue → fire deferred Assign on AMS load | `nfc_empty_slot_queue_watcher` |
| NFC: Commit desktop Assign (no tag) | `nfc_assign_commit_desktop` |
| BB Reconciler: 5-min poll | `nfc_bb_reconciler_poll` |
| BB Reconciler: slot-change kicker | `nfc_bb_reconciler_event` |
| BB Reconciler: startup sync | `nfc_bb_reconciler_startup` |
| BB Reconciler: manual run-now | `nfc_bb_reconciler_manual` |
| NFC: Capture scanned tag (V1's `tag_scanned` listener) | `nfc_capture_scanned_tag` |

The 8th cannot write to the AMS by itself, but left on it consumes every V2 scan into V1's
helpers and can fire V1 notifications — disable it too so V1 is fully deaf. Also set
`input_boolean.bb_reconciler_enabled` **off** (the manual automation above bypasses it, which
is why it's disabled directly).

**Verify before the first assign** — in Developer Tools → Template, confirm all 8 read `off`:

```jinja
{{ ['automation.nfc_phase_a_dispatch','automation.nfc_empty_slot_queue_watcher',
    'automation.nfc_assign_commit_desktop','automation.nfc_bb_reconciler_poll',
    'automation.nfc_bb_reconciler_event','automation.nfc_bb_reconciler_startup',
    'automation.nfc_bb_reconciler_manual','automation.nfc_capture_scanned_tag']
   | map('states') | list }}
```

**Leave running**: Profile-Sync (`nfc_profile_sync_daily`, only PATCHes Spoolman), AMS drying
(`packages/ams_dry.yaml` — a separate subsystem V2 does not replace), and the Spoolman
service/integration itself (V1 still reads it; the Bambuddy↔Spoolman *toggle* being off does
not touch it).

### If you also run a V2 on another HA box (e.g. a dev instance)
Two V2 instances pointed at the same Bambuddy both poll harmlessly, but an assign from either
box hits the same physical trays. After cutover, quiesce the non-primary V2 (disable its
integration, or simply don't drive its dashboard) so there is a single writer.
